Exercise 6-1
If set A = {L M N O P} and set B = {P Q R S T}, what sets are generated by the follow‐
ing operations?
• A union B
• A union all B
• A intersect B
• A except B
1. A union B = {L M N O P Q R S T}
2. A union all B = {L M N O P P Q R S T}
3. A intersect B = {P}
4. A except B = {L M N O}

Exercise 6-2
Write a compound query that finds the first and last names of all actors and custom‐
ers whose last name starts with L.
mysql> SELECT first_name, last_name
-> FROM actor
-> WHERE last_name LIKE 'L%'
-> UNION
-> SELECT first_name, last_name
-> FROM customer
-> WHERE last_name LIKE 'L%';

Exercise 6-3
Sort the results from Exercise 6-2 by the last_name column.
mysql> SELECT first_name, last_name
-> FROM actor
-> WHERE last_name LIKE 'L%'
-> UNION
-> SELECT first_name, last_name
-> FROM customer
-> WHERE last_name LIKE 'L%'
-> ORDER BY last_name;
