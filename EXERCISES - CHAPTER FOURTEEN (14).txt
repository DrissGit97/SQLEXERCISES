Exercise 14-2
The film rental company manager would like to have a report that includes the name
of every country, along with the total payments for all customers who live in each
country. Generate a view definition that queries the country table and uses a scalar
subquery to calculate a value for a column named tot_payments.

CREATE VIEW country_payments
AS
SELECT c.country,
(SELECT sum(p.amount)
FROM city ct
INNER JOIN address a
ON ct.city_id = a.city_id
INNER JOIN customer cst
ON a.address_id = cst.address_id
INNER JOIN payment p
ON cst.customer_id = p.customer_id
WHERE ct.country_id = c.country_id
) tot_payments
FROM country c
